  This section describes the logical network interfaces of the device.
  Interfaces as their primary have a role that is upstream, downstream,
  guest, ....
type: object
properties:
  name:
    description:
      This is a free text field, stating the administrative name of the

  role:
    description:

    type: string
    enum:
      - upstream
      - downstream
    uc-example: downstream
  isolate-hosts:
    description:
      This option makes sure that any traffic leaving this interface is isolated
      and all local IP ranges are blocked. It essentially enforces "guest network"
      firewall settings.
    type: boolean
    uc-example: false
  metric:
    description:
      The routing metric of this logical interface. Lower values have higher
      priority.
    type: boolean
    default: 10
    uc-example: 10
